## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Improving the semantics of the HTML, more organized CSS and some new tricks like counter in the li and ::maker that I had never used before.

### Continued development

Responsive CSS has still been challenging, it's not looking like the original design even trying % instead of px size, there are still some small errors, but I believe it's improving a lot.
